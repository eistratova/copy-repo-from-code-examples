classify plankton images

# issues
data imbalance
scale change of different objects

issue with data
      - diff file sizes, non-square
     - label name not clear
     - CompVision based features used in papaer: meaning & how calculated?
issue with image data handling steps 
     - how to provide input to the algo
     - handling different classes
     - detecting & handling outliers

how to scale data in different layers (Andew ng)?
how to choose no.of epochs?

1. gonophore_diphyidae is similar to aglaura !!
2. different images at different scales?
    images at different size-> RESIZE
3. understand labels - diffeent artefacts, fiber, bubble, head, scale etc.
4. badfocus_copepoda vs part_copepoda, 
5. why some folders have similar labels.
6. how many distinct classes?
