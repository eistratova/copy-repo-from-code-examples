#### important points:

1. balance the data (subsample or SMOTE)
2. standard scaling performs better than minmax scaling with SVM, and improves its results to those from random forest classifier
3. SVM with balanced weightes performs better than unbalanced
4. It is important to choose a smaller time window for PAA (SAX method), but not too small to increase the computation
