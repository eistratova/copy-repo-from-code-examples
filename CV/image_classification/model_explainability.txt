PROBLEM STATEMENT: Can we use GradCAM to show the defective region (as predicted by the model) on the image, when using classification models?

SAMPLE DATA: NEU dataset

TASKS:
need to set up code to run with test images, which are not part of imagedatabunch
output should show the test images with the heat map
compare this to raw test images with ground truth (GT) bounding box
