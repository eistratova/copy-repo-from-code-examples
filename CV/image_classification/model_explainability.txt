PROBLEM STATEMENT: Can we use GradCAM to show the defective region (as predicted by the model) on the image, when using classification models?

SAMPLE DATA: NEU dataset

TASKS:
need to set up code to run with test images, which are not part of imagedatabunch
output should show the test images with the heat map
compare this to raw test images with ground truth (GT) bounding box

this blog is trying separate maps for each of the classes https://towardsdatascience.com/multi-label-classification-and-class-activation-map-on-fashion-mnist-1454f09f5925
Another link https://github.com/mingming97/multilabel-cam   this is marked as multi-label - will need to check if this works
https://glassboxmedicine.com/2020/05/29/grad-cam-visual-explanations-from-deep-networks/   says we should be able to use this for multiple classes
