Segmentation in medical domain - the algo should work on images from multiple sources. Try nuclei segmentation. 
For agnosticism try Stain normalization , Color pertubation using HistonomicsTK. 
For instance when working with CT scans and MRI scans , for removing noise there are diffent filter types you can use , 
like the Non local means edge preserving filter.
Interest: validation algos wherein you do not have enough Ground truth, and where you have multiple varying Ground truths. 
           For Multiple varying groundtruths you can use STaple A\Lgo .
           
Dataset: the cancer imaging archive , research gate, paperswithcode.
