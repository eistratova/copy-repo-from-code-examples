# IMAGE SEGMENTATION TECH.
1. Thresholding method - Based on peaks â€“ Simplest method 
2. Edge based method - Not suitable for our use case 
3. Region based method (Time expensive, immune to noise, portioning images into homogenous regions)
4. Clustering method (Based on division in homogenous clusters, More useful in real time problems)
5. Watershed method (Better at Boundary detection)
6. NN : Unets, Mask R-CNN /Fast R-CNN (Efficient and better accuracy)
