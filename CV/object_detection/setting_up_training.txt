Changed a few parameters : batch size, width and height

1. How to assess localization algo has trained sufficiently – is there an optimal mAP ? 
  Right now, we are stopping when there are no changes in mAP for a few cycles.
  can look at loss <= half of starting loss

2. Generally, we use the val set to tune model parameters & find optimal model – is something similar being done for localization? 
  Which parameters are we tuning for localization?

3. If we are not using the val set to tune for alternate models & only using for testing, do we need a separate test set? 

4. We should also be checking recall, not just precision (as in pycoco tool)
