How to check for overfitting? is there scope for early stopping?
Can both train & val loss be checked in tensorboard?

the events file generated during training has to be opened via tensorboard to monitor training progress
1. the events file generated when training on colab is not updating , only 40 B in size
2. the events file generated when training on local linux is of larger size (~277 MB for 500 steps) â€“ so it is getting updated there
we may need to save the STOUT as a log file, & use the loss values printed there for checking training progress
