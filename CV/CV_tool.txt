images from different spectra


Flexible deployment model (Hybrid, Cloud, Edge) - Optimize for edge processing


Independent code modules for Image Uploads, Model training, Inferencing
Use of Dockers for customized deployments based on the DL platform
Audit Trail for Model Building


Easy-to-use navigation
Dashboard KPIs to quickly understand status / analytics
Segregated user personas for different tasks


Choice of algorithm, based on requirement and annotations available (anomaly detection , classification, detection)
Choose the Model Architecture and modify the hyperparameters
Continuous learning: Accommodate new classes and update existing models - Automated Model Drift detection; 
                     raise re-training request (deployment only after vetting, HIL)
Integrated data labeling tool
Custom image pre-processing, post-processing (resize, tile, file compression formats, etc)
     Algorithm Intelligence to detect & correct image quality (vibration correction, poor light, other interference)
     Detect & remove corrupt images


Workflow management

Integrated camera registration and configuration, for easier data collection & metadata tagging
PLC integration , AR/VR integration *




CHALLENGES:
Data imbalance
Different scale of item of interest 
Different image sizes
Large intra-class variations, less inter-class variations
