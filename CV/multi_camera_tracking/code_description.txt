# steps to find common detections b/w multiple cam

1. create videos with 'simulated overlap' by splitting frames into left & right with overlap
    create_frame_overlapped_video.py
    
2. compare starting frames in the overlapped videos, to get overlapping FOV
    match_left_right_images.py 

3. For subsequent frames, use the captured detections & the FOV, to find common detections
    compare_detections_on_LR.py
