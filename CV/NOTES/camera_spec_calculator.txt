# calculate camera specs (resolution, focal length), based on field of view (FOV), minimum measurable length & working distance (W) 

If image-to-object dist is less than focal length (object very close to camera), then image will be out of focus.
"Working distance" means the optimal "should be" distance to get good focus.
"Object distance" means the actual distance b/w it & camera. It should be close to Working distance if we want pics to be focused.

# Image capture:
1. uniform lighting
2. reduce dust & heat with camera housing & cooling system
3. Motion artifact minimization: Take steps to reduce blur in images in presence of vibration.
	- use of short exposure times (speedy image capture), 
	- cameras with global shutters 
	- the use of vibration dampeners. 
	- periodic camera recalibration is required to mitigate motion artifacts (not valid for systems with continuous vibration). 
	- Smaller blurring effects can be corrected through image pre-processing with appropriate deblurring filters, provided they do not give rise to additional artifacts in the context of quality inspection

The choice of camera lens resolution is guided by 
1. the dimensions of the minimum defect size to be imaged. 
2. Additional constraints may arise from the working distance available for mounting the cameras

key camera parameters are: 
1. resolution (in pixels), 
2. spatial resolution that is how many pixels-per-inch (ppi) on the sensor, 
3. focal length, 
4. the zoom level required to accommodate the area of interest
5. field of view (FOV), which is the angular measurement window that can be seen by the lens




# PART 1: sensor resolution
sensor resolution = Pixel_min x (FOV) / smallest feature
pixel_min: no. of pixels spanning the feature of minimum size
FOV and smallest feature to be measured should be in mm
sensor resolution is in pixel
camera sensor resolution should be greater than or equal to that calculated in this formula
NOTE: if FOV is X*Y, calculate the above formula with X and Y separately


SAMPLE CALCULATION	
FOV (mm)	900
smallest feature (mm)	10
pixel_min	40
resolution (pixel)	3600



# PART 2: sensor size
sensor size = pixel size x resolution
choose a camera from the link - find pixel size from specs

SAMPLE CALCULATION		
pixel size (um)	   1.25  	1.25
resolution (pixel)	4912	3684
		
sensor size (mm)	 6.14	  4.605
diagonal sensor size (mm)	7.675	




# PART 3: focal length
focal length x FOV = sensor size x working distance



Common lens focal lengths include 6 mm, 8 mm, 12.5 mm, 25 mm, and 50 mm. 
Once you choose a lens whose focal length is closest to the focal length required by your imaging system, 
you need to adjust the working distance to get the object under inspection in focus.


Note: Lenses with short focal lengths (less than 12 mm) produce images with a significant amount of distortion. 
If your application is sensitive to image distortion, try to increase the working distance and use a lens with a higher focal length. 
If you cannot change the working distance, you are somewhat limited in choosing a lens.




SAMPLE CALCULATION (for focal length)		
sensor size (mm)	7.675	
FOV (mm)	900	
working distance (mm)	1350	
		
focal length (mm)	11.5125	
		
		
INFERENCE		
focal length of 8mm will give working distance < 1350 mm; this focal length is supposed to give distortion		




SAMPLE CALCULATION (for working distance	
sensor size (mm)	7.67
FOV	900
focal length (mm)	12
	
working distance (mm)	1408.083442

If image-to-object dist is less than focal length, then out of focus.
If you take an object very close to camera, then it will be out of focus.
"Working dist" means the optimal "should be" dist to get good focus.
"Object dist" means the actual dist b/w it & camera. It should be close to Working dist if u want pics to be focused.
