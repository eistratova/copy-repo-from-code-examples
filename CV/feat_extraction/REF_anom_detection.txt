VAE vs AE? 
Intermediate & latent dimension
Metrics used for Autoencoders
Codes for color image (3 dimensions)

1.  VAE based method doesn't work for highly similar images with small differences (Not much distinguishable features - Reconstruction loss too high), 
     it works well for distinctly different classes
2. Image similarity: comparison using distance measures (between 0 and 1)
3. Extract features using CNN & use standard classifiers like SVMs
