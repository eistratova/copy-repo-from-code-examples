# Distance calculation using reference object, no camera parameters

Inputs: 
actual size of reference object (W), distance of reference object from camera (D), image dimension of reference object (P)

Using triangle similarity, perceived focal length, F (in pixels) = D x P / W
For any new object, object distance D’ = F x (object actual size)/ (image size)

Issues:
Manual effort to set up a reference object (known size), and measure its distance correctly – F measurement is not very accurate without true camera calibration
Clearly able to identify reference object in image
Should know size of each new object detected

Distance to object (mm) = f (mm)  x  real height (mm)  x  image height (pixels) / [ object height (pixels)  x  sensor height (mm) ]

# Distance calculation using camera parameters

camera calibration:
Obtain focal length from calibration (in mm) & substitute in triangle formula
distance_mm = object_real_world_mm * focal_length_mm / object_image_sensor_mm


Issues:
We are not doing this calibration as part of our current algorithm
Need camera sensor details (pixels per millimeter (px/mm))
