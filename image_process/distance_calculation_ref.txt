Inputs: 
actual size of reference object (W), distance of reference object from camera (D), image dimension of reference object (P)

Using triangle similarity, perceived focal length, F (in pixels) = D x P / W
For any new object, object distance D’ = F x (object actual size)/ (image size)

Issues:
Manual effort to set up a reference object (known size), and measure its distance correctly – F measurement is not very accurate without true camera calibration
Clearly able to identify reference object in image
Should know size of each new object detected
